## Project Description

[Brief description of the project in your own words]
BitHub is a social app that lets users share their emotions in real time by posting mood updates.
Users can choose from a list of emotions, add a short description, and indicate if theyâ€™re with a group feeling the same way.
They can also search for and follow other users, comment on moods, and engage in conversations.
The app features a dynamic mood map feed, giving users a real-time view of emotional trends in their area and beyond, fostering connection, empathy, and shared experiences.
